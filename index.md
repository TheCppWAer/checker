# Coding note(C++)

## For initial
```c++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
  return 0;
}
```
### iostream
For initial, you need include a title which is for basic language. In this case, we use **iostream** , use it to unlock basic I/O system.

### namespace
Without this commend, you should use std:: in front of most of commend. Because of our laziness, we always put it in front of main function.

### main
Main function, the most important in the project. Running any project, computer will find where the **main function** is. Without main function, the project worth 0.

So, the initial part is done. Isn't it easy?

## Novice data structure
int --> interger (-2^32<=0<=2^32-1)

long long --> longer interger 

double --> decimal

char --> 

string -->
