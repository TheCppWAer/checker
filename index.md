# Coding note

## for initial
```c++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
  return 0;
}
```
### iostream
For initial, you need include a title which is for basic language. In this case, we use **iostream** , use it to unlock basic I/O system.

### namespace
Without this commend, you should use std:: in front of most of commend,it's default in C++.
